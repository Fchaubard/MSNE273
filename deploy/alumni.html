	<h3>MS&E 273 Alumni Quotes</h3>
	<p class="block"> 
	"A ton of work, and a great class!"
	<br />
	<br />"I will recommend this class to someone who wants to be an entrepreneur. This is a great class, exciting, but also, it is a lot of work, and if you don't love [entrepreneurship], you won't like it."
	<br />
	<br />"I absolutely would recommend this class to other students interested in starting a business. I think the class did a great job of focusing on the key aspects of starting a business without belabouring any point. It was fast-paced and challenging, which I like, and intense. It really opened my eyes to a whole world I was ignorant of before."
	<br />
	<br />"I would not recommend this to anyone who is not serious about it or does not have the time commitment. That fosters really bad team relations and is unfair to other teammates. I was glad to see that you made that very explicit in the beginning, so there were no surprises."
	<br />
	<br />"This was the best class I have taken at Stanford. [...] I learned a lot in the lectures, which is irregular for a non-homework type class, and learned even more working with my team. I spent probably double the time I have ever spent in any other course."
	<br />
	<br />"This class alone made coming to Stanford worth it!" 
	<br />
	<br />"MS&amp;E273 is hands down the best way to learn what life in a startup is like.  This was the most useful class I took throughout my two years at Stanford. I'm putting learning into action by pursuing my own startup."
	<br />
	<br />"The experience of 273 has helped immensely in our ability to write and present a focused and relevant plan for the company."
	<br />
	<br />"Beyond the tangible advice or skills learned, my biggest takeaway from the class was the impetus to stop talking about an idea and actually take steps to execute it."
	<br />
	<br />"The class provided a very realistic experience for entrepreneurial students to build a business plan from scratch and pitch to top-tier VCs." 
	<br />
	<br />"The class provides a balanced mix of lectures, speakers, and hands-on work. It's a great launchpad for aspiring student entrepreneurs and equally valuable for those who have entrepreneurial plans later in their lives."
